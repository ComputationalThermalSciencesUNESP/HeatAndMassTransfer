# HeatAndMassTransfer #

### What is this repository for? ###

Repository with files of exercises, tutorials and theory about the Heat and
Mass Transfer discipline teached at the Mechanical Engineering course of the
São Paulo State University (UNESP), School of Engineering, Bauru.  

### How do I get set up? ###

Currently, the tutorials use mainly NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, with interactive
plots of IPywidgets. The requirements.txt file to set up your own environment
is available in the repo. If you are using an Anaconda distribution (like me),
run the following command to create an environment to run the notebooks:

´$ conda create -n <environment-name> --file requirements.txt´
